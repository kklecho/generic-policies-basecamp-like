# Privacy Regulation Reference

The data privacy regulatory landscape is undergoing a lot of change. You probably have heard about the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that went into effect on May 25, 2018. There are also other regulations in the works around the world. We’ve written up this reference document to put information about our compliance with privacy regulations in one place.

## Are {{ product_name }} products in compliance?

First things first, you should view our full [Privacy policy](../index.md).

- We are in compliance with the [General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”)](https://gdpr.eu/). We participate in the [EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework](https://www.privacyshield.gov/) to safeguard the transfer of personal data to the US.
- We are in the process of ensuring compliance with the [California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”)](https://www.oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa) and have expanded your rights in our privacy policy accordingly.
- We are also watching and preparing for other legislation in the US and in other countries.

We will update this document as we ensure compliance with other regulations.

We are *not* [HIPAA](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security/laws-regulations/index.html)-compliant and currently do not have plans to become so.

## GDPR: data processing addendum

Increasingly, privacy regulations require processing of personal data be governed by a data processing addendum (DPA) that is compliant with those regulations.

We provide a standard [Data Processing Addendum](https://app.hellosign.com/s/c0908a3d) (DPA) that is [GDPR-compliant](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-28-gdpr/) to extend GDPR privacy principles, rights, and obligations everywhere personal data is processed. If you use our products to process any EU personal data, you need to enter into GDPR-compliant data processing agreements with any online services and third party vendors you rely on, including {{ owner_legal_name }}.

**✍️ [Sign the DPA online](https://app.hellosign.com/s/c0908a3d).**

{{ product_name }} participates in the [EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework](https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000TP1OAAW&status=Active) to safeguard the transfer of personal data to the US, meeting the GDPR requirement for adequate data protection laws.

## Subprocessors

{{ product_name }} uses third party subprocessors, such as cloud computing providers and customer support software, to provide our services. We enter into GDPR-compliant data processing agreements with each subprocessor, and require the same of them.

You can see which subprocessors we use by application by viewing the following linked lists:

* [{{ product_name }} subprocessors](../basecamp-subprocessors/index.md)

## CCPA: our role as a service provider

In the CCPA, there is an important distinction between what are referred to as “service providers”, “businesses”, and “third parties”. You can see how the regulation defines these words by visiting the California Attorney General’s website: https://www.oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa.

Under the CCPA, {{ product_name }} is a “service provider.” That means when we process data you provide, we do so solely for the purpose you signed up for. Our business model is simple: we charge a recurring subscription fee to our customers. We do not sell personal information or use your data for any other commercial purposes unless with your explicit permission.

The CCPA also grants residents of California with additional rights related to their information. We grant those rights to all of our customers and detail them in our Privacy policy. Our Privacy policy also explains the information we collect in order to provide our services and clearly lists the only times we access or share your data.
